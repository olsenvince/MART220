I chose a sketch that I found on the p5.js tutorial website to compare with mine. I realised that it probably would have been easier to adjust the mountains and
add color to them if I had used the triangles instead of lines. So I really liked that idea with the sample sketch that I found. I also wanted to add stars and moving clouds but I ran out of time. 
I like how clean the sample sketch looked, and it makes me wish I had added more color or depth overal.
